Concrete has a wide variation of cement contents for the same strength class of concrete. This adds additional uncertainty to this data by strength class. There is no substitute for finding out the actual cement content used in a mixture (not specified min cement content - actual cement content used by the contractor). The cement content for your mixture at this strength class might be a very different value than assumed here.","Cradle to gate, A1-3",, ,1,m3,2385,2385, , , , , ,329.7225043,0.1382, , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,4.91,2.03,4.98,4.95,1.04,17.91,N/A,72%, ,No,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A,N/A, , ,V3.0 Beta,May-19,,360 kg cementitious content per m3 concrete.,ready-mix,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
