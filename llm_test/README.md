# Langchain App Challenge ðŸ¦œðŸ”—

Welcome to the final challenge of the day, where you'll leverage the power of Transformer-based models by creating a LangChain app that automatically reviews code. This challenge will push beyond simplistic Transformer models and show what we can achieve by taking large, powerful, pre-trained models and integrating them with our own data.

## Step 1: Python Environment Setup
Create a Python Virtual Environment: For this challenge, you'll need to create a Python virtual environment using pyenv and virtualenv. This isolates your project dependencies from your global Python installation - we have provided you with specific requirements in a `langchain_requirements.txt` file for specifically this challenge and we don't want you to tamper with other versions you have in your `lewagon` environment.


```bash
pyenv virtualenv 3.10.6 langchain
pyenv local langchain
pip install -r "https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/deep_learning_datasets/langchain_requirements.txt"
```

## Step 2: Obtain and Secure Your OpenAI API Key

Obtain an OpenAI API Key: If you haven't already, sign up for an OpenAI account and obtain your API key by following the instructions [here](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api). You'll start with $5 of credit, which is ample for this challenge.

Secure Your API Key: Store your OpenAI API key in an environment variable named OPENAI_API_KEY. This is crucial for security, as hardcoding your API key in your source code can lead to unintended exposure and misuse.

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
```

You can access it within your script using a line such as `openai_api_key = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')`. If this seems unfamiliar, don't worry - you'll be working with environment variables a lot more in MLOps week!


## Step 3: Understanding the Challenge

**What is LangChain?**

LangChain is a framework designed for building applications powered by language models. It supports data-aware and agentic applications, allowing language models to interact with their environment and other data sources. LangChain simplifies working with LLMs, offering modular components for building or customizing applications. You can check out its documentation [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) with some (very) helpful tutorials.

**The App Functionality**

Your task is to create a Python file named app.py that:

Takes the location of a code file as an argument (remember `sys.argv` from the very first day of the course?)
Outputs a score out of 10, evaluating the quality of the coded solution, along with suggestions for improvement.

For example:

```bash
python app.py "../../../01-Python/03-SQL-Basics/04-Interacting-With-Code/queries.py"
```
might output:

```
The code is a 6/10. Improvements that can be made include adding a docstring to the functions, using more descriptive variable names, and formatting the code better for improved readability.
```

Leverage the LangChain framework and your OpenAI API key to create the described application. This app will demonstrate your ability to integrate language models into software applications, providing valuable feedback on code quality and suggesting improvements.

Remember to set a usage limit on your OpenAI account to avoid unexpected charges and to deactivate your LangChain virtual environment when you're done working on the challenge.

***Good luck, and have fun building your Langchain app! ðŸš€ðŸ¦œðŸš€***
